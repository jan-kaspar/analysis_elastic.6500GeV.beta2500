\section{Datasets}

\> fills: 5313, 5314, 5317, 5321

\> \plot{time_dependences/rate_vs_time.pdf}: in run 5317 there are 2 periods where diagonal 45 top -- 56 bottom doesn't get (all) data
\>> reason: 1 problematic RP in that diagonal
\>> consequence: the 2 periods are removed from the analysis

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Ntuples}

\> current: /eos/totem/data/offline/2016/2500m/version2/
\>> planes without alignment excluded from reconstruction

\> old: /eos/totem/data/offline/2016/2500m/version1/
\>> has a reconstruction problem in 45-210-fr-bt
\>>> 4 planes often missing in data
\>>> these 4 planes excluded from track-based alignment
\>>> these 4 planes not aligned with the others
\>>> when these 4 planes available in an event $\rightarrow$ reconstruction bias $\approx 50\un{\mu m}$ apparent in cut 6

\section{Reconstruction formulae}

\> method: study various reconstruction formulae with MC

\> \plot{reconstruction_formulae/plot_formulae_graphs.pdf} : study of performance of various reconstruction formulae
\>> formulae
\>>> using different RPs as input
\>>> combining the input in various ways
\>> studying the impact of various effects: beam divergence, vertex, pitch, ...

\> \plot{reconstruction_formulae/plot_formulae_correlation.pdf} : study of left-right correlations of angle reconstruction errors

\> observations for horizontal plane
\>> single arm: best is the ``regression'' formula with vertex-contribution suppression; the leading error comes from detector resolution
\>> double arm: vertex cancels automatically due to the optics symmetry, thus:
\>>> best: LR average of ``hit'' formula
\>>> LR average of ``regression'' formula is worse -- the error induced by detector resolution is amplified by the (unnecessary) vertex-suppression on single-arm level
\>> therefore two different reconstructions used in the analysis: ``regression'' formula for cuts, ``hit'' formula for the rest

\> formulae used for cuts
\>> horizontal plane
\>>> single arm: $\displaystyle \th_x^{*,LR} = \mp { v_x^{210F}\,x^{220F} - v^{220F}\,x^{210F} \over v^{210F}\,L^{220F} - v^{220F}\,L^{210F} }$,
$\displaystyle x^{*,LR} = { x^{210F}\,L_x^{220F} - x^{220F}\,L_x^{210F} \over v^{210F}\,L^{220F} - v^{220F}\,L^{210F} }$
\>>> double arm: average of single arm, $\th_x^* = (\th_x^{*,R} + \th_x^{*,L}) / 2$
\>> vertical plane
\>>> single arm: $\displaystyle \th_y^{*,LR} = \mp {1\over 2} \left( {y^{210F}\over L_y^{210F}} + {y^{220F}\over L_y^{220F}} \right)$
\>>> double arm: average of single arm, $\th_y^* = (\th_y^{*,R} + \th_y^{*,L}) / 2$

\> formulae used for the rest (distributions etc.)
\>> horizontal plane
\>>> single arm: $\displaystyle \th_x^{*,LR} = \mp {1\over 2} \left( {x^{210F}\over L_x^{210F}} + {x^{220F}\over L_x^{220F}} \right)$
\>>> double arm: average of single arm, $\th_x^* = (\th_x^{*,R} + \th_x^{*,L}) / 2$
\>> vertical plane
\>>> single arm: $\displaystyle \th_y^{*,LR} = \mp {1\over 2} \left( {y^{210F}\over L_y^{210F}} + {y^{220F}\over L_y^{220F}} \right)$

\section{Resolution}

\subsection{Reconstruction for cuts}

\> uses the reconstruction formula with per-arm horizontal-vertex deconvolution

\> method
\>> horizontal plane
\>>> left-right difference of $\th_x^*$ sensitive to beam divergence and detector (RP) resolution
\>>> beam divergence determined from $\si(x^*)$
\>>> detector resolution then deconvolved from $\De^{R-L} \th_x^*$ and $\si(x^*)$ and is checked to be time-independent
\>> vertical plane
\>>> left-right difference of $\th_y^*$ directly probes the vertical beam divergence (the detector component is negligible)

\> \plot{resolutions/resolutions_for_cuts_vs_time.pdf}: summary of resolution components as a function of time
\>> among others gives: horizontal vertex size, horizontal beam divergence, mean RP resolution

\subsection{Reconstruction for distributions}

\> uses the reconstruction formula without explicit horizontal-vertex deconvolution

\> method
\>> horizontal plane
\>>> single arm $\th_x^*$ reconstruction biased by neglecting $x^*$
\>>> this bias in left-right antisymmetric, see \plot{reconstruction_formulae/plot_formulae_correlation.pdf}
\>>> therefore $\De^{R-L} \th_x^*$ is dominated by the vertex term
\>>> and the 2-arm reconstruction (L-R average) is almost free of the bias
\>>> this can not be extracted directly from data, but can be studied with a MC tuned to data results obtained with the reconstruction formula for cuts

\>>> mean and difference from the two cases: $\si(m_x) = (0.26 \pm 0.04)\un{\mu rad}$

\section{Background, efficiency and purity of cuts}

\subsection{Background studies}

\> background: non-elastic events passing the tagging cuts

\> ``anti-diagonal`` data
\>> from configurations: 45 top -- 56 top, 45 bot -- 56 bot
\>> sign of $y$ swapped in sector 45 to process the data with the standard chain
\>> cannot contain any signal
\>> background expected similar as in diagonals

\> methods
\>> method 1: plot distributions of cut discriminators under various cut combinations, see\\ \plot{background,cut_efficiency/cut_distributions.pdf}
\>>> central part (signal): unaffected by cuts
\>>> tails (background): drops with increasing number of cuts
\>>> however: unknown interpolation of background from tails to the signal region
\>> method 2: plot distributions of cut discriminators also for anti-diagonal configurations, see\\ \plot{background,cut_efficiency/cut_dist_antidgn_cmp.pdf}
\>>> good agreement in tails -- confirmation that the background is indeed similar in diagonals and anti-diagonals
\>>> anti-diagonals provide shape of interpolation to the signal region -- flat

\> results
\>> \plot{background,cut_efficiency/cut_dist_antidgn_cmp.pdf}: distributions of cut discriminators, after all available cuts, comparison between diagonal and anti-diagonal configurations
\>>> by comparing the signal (diagonals) and background (anti-diagonals) peak: rough estimate of $B/S \ls 10^{-4}$

\>> \plot{background,cut_efficiency/t_dist_antidgn_cmp.pdf}: $t$-distributions, after all available cuts, comparison between diagonal (mostly signal) and anti-diagonal (background) configurations
\>>> background only available at low $|t|$ where $\ls 10^{-4}$

\> additional material
\>> \plot{background,cut_efficiency/t_distributions_cuts.pdf}: $t$-distributions under various cut combinations
\>>> gives data reduction by each of the cut

\subsection{Study of signal loss due to cuts}

\> method
\>> plot $t$ distributions at different cut levels ($n_\si$)

\> \plot{background,cut_efficiency/t_distributions_n_si_cmp_fill.pdf}: $t$ distribution at different cut levels, for all fills
\>> qualitatively similar results from all fills

\> \plot{background,cut_efficiency/t_distributions_n_si_cmp_binning.pdf}: $t$ distribution at different cut levels, for all binnings
\>> with fine binnings, bands (barely but) visible
\>>> most likely because of the difference in bin contents is a small integer: 1, 2, 3, ...
\>>> for $|t| \gs 0.4\un{GeV^2}$, the relative differences are larger when smaller bins -- large interplay with statistics

\> results
\>> $|t| \ls 0.2\un{GeV^2}$
\>>> difference between $n_\si = 4$ (standard) and $5$ is about $0.5\un{\%}$ and almost flat
\>> $|t| \gs 0.4\un{GeV^2}$
\>>> difference between $n_\si = 4$ (standard) and $5$ is few percent
\>>> differences covered by statistical uncertainties


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Acceptance correction}

\subsection{Theory}

\vskip3mm

The smearing (beam, detector, ...) can be formally described as change of the true scattering angle, $\th_x$, to the reconstructed angle, $\th'_x$, (for brevity the stars are suppressed):
\eqref{
\th'_x = \th_x + \De \th_x
}{de th x}
The smearing may be different the left (L) and right (R) arm and can be decomposed as
\eqref{
\De\th_x^{\rm R} = m_x + {\d_x\over 2}\ ,\qquad \De\th_x^{\rm L} = m_x - {\d_x\over 2}\ ,
}{m d to th L R}
where $m_x$ modifies the L-R average while $d_x$ modifies the L-R difference:
\eqref{
m_x = {\De\th_x^{\rm R} + \De\th_x^{\rm L}\over 2}\ ,\qquad d_x = \De\th_x^{\rm R} - \De\th_x^{\rm L}\ .
}{th L R to m d}

The smearing and acceptance effects can then be described as transformation from true, $h_{\rm true}$, to reconstructed, $h_{\rm reco}$, probability distribution functions (PDFs):
\eqref{
\eqnarray{
	h_{\rm reco}(\th'_x, \th'_y) & = & \int \d\th_x \int \d\th_y\ h_{\rm true}(\th_x, \th_y) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \int \d m_x\ G_{m_x}(m_x) \int \d m_y\ G_{m_y}(m_y) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \int \d d_x\ G_{d_x}(d_x) \int \d d_y\ G_{d_y}(d_y) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \de\left( \th'_x - (\th_x + m_x) \right) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \de\left( \th'_y - (\th_y + m_y) \right) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \Th(\hbox{acc.~cond.}) \ ,\cr
}
}{sm acc model}
where the $G$ functions give distributions of the smearing parameters, thus the model assumes that the $m_{x,y}$ and $d_{x,y}$ parameters are independent (uncorrelated). The $\Th$ function expresses the acceptance condition. As the condition can be written in terms of $\th'_{x,y}$ and $d_{x,y}$, i.e.~the cuts are done in the smeared coordinates, \Eq{sm acc model} can be factorised as
\eqref{
	h_{\rm reco}(\th'_x, \th'_y) = h_{\rm smear}(\th'_x, \th'_y)\ F_{\rm acc}(\th'_x, \th'_y)\ .
}{sm acc model fac}
The first factor
\eqref{
\eqnarray{
	h_{\rm smear}(\th'_x, \th'_y) & = & \int \d\th_x \int \d\th_y\ h_{\rm true}(\th_x, \th_y) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \int \d m_x\ G_{m_x}(m_x) \int \d m_y\ G_{m_y}(m_y) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \de\left( \th'_x - (\th_x + m_x) \right) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \de\left( \th'_y - (\th_y + m_y) \right) \cr
}
}{sm model}
gives the PDF corresponding to the case where only smearing was applied. The effect of acceptance cuts is all contained in the second term:
\eqref{
\eqnarray{
	F_{\rm acc}(\th'_x, \th'_y) & = & \int \d d_x\ G_{d_x}(d_x) \int \d d_y\ G_{d_y}(d_y) \cr
								 &  & \cdot \Th(\hbox{acc.~cond.}) \ .\cr
}
}{acc model}

In the data reconstruction, one builds histogram(s) using weight $1 / F_{\rm acc}$ which according to \Eq{sm acc model fac} estimates $h_{\rm smear}$ wherever there is non-zero acceptance. A particularly interesting histogram is in $t$, or in equivalently in $\th$ which can be modelled as
\eqref{H_{\rm smear}(\th) = \int\limits_{\Om(\th)} \ \d\ph\ h_{\rm smear}(\th \cos\ph, \th\sin\ph)\ ,}{sm model th}
where $\Om(\th)$ is a set of $\ph$ values with non-zero acceptance. In order to recover the part with zero acceptance, one can introduce a correction
\eqref{H_{\rm smear,corr}(\th) = {1\over A_{\ph}(\th)} H_{\rm smear}(\th)\ ,}{sm model th corr}
\eqref{A_{\ph}(\th) = {1\over 2\pi} \int\limits_{\Om(\th)} \ \d\ph\ .}{A phi}
This correction assumes azimuthal ($\ph$) symmetry of $h_{\rm smear}$ which is typically slightly broken due to different smearing in $\th_x$ and $\th_y$. The error induced is typically absorbed into the ``unfolding correction'' which is applied in the final step of the analysis.

\subsection{Fiducial cuts}

\> there two types of fiducial cuts
\>> separately in left and right arm
\>>> cuts corresponding to the actual limits (sensors, LHC)
\>>> they correspond to the condition $\Th$ in \Eq{acc model}
\>> cut in global (after averaging) $\th_{x, y}$
\>>> in order to avoid regions where $F_{\rm acc}$ is too small (and thus the corresponding weight too large)
\>>> they enter via the set $\Om$ in \Eq{sm model th}

\> all cuts have two bounds (illustrated in \plot{acceptance_correction/acc_phi_lab.pdf})
\>> at low $|\th_y^*|$: due to sensor edge
\>> at higher $|\th_y^*|$): due to LHC apertures

\> all cuts are defined empirically by selecting a region within which one expects full acceptance ($\Th \equiv 1$ in \Eq{acc model}), shown in \plot{acceptance_correction/acc_cmp_fill_details.pdf}
\>> there is evident effect of the upstream 210-fr RPs which are tilted, causing inefficiency -- this region is cut out

\> \plot{acceptance_correction/fiducial_cut_cmp.pdf}: comparison of fiducial cuts


\subsection{Smearing correction}

\> ``smearing correction'' denotes the factor $1/F_{\rm acc}$
\>> it is calculated according to \Eq{acc model}, assuming Gaussian distributions of $d_{x,y}$, using numerical integration (GSL library)
\>> it is applied as described below \Eq{acc model}


\subsection{$\ph$ correction}

\> ``$\ph$ correction'' refers to $1 / A_{\ph}$
\>> it is calculated according to \Eq{A phi}
\>> it is applied according to \Eq{sm model th corr}


\> \plot{acceptance_correction/acc_cmp_fill.pdf} : verification of the assumed $\ph$ symmetry


\subsection{Program implementation, validation}

\> there are two implementations of \Eq{acc model}
\>> ``old''
\>>> assumes no dependence of acceptance condition of $d_x$, thus integrates over $d_y$ only
\>>> assumes Gaussian distribution of $d_y$
\>> ``new'': no assumptions needed, implemented as numerical integration using routines from GSL
\>>> for performance optimisation, this implementation {\it may} assume gaussianity of $d_y$

\> \plot{acceptance_correction/validation/validation_vs_old.pdf} : comparison of old and new implementations -- perfect agreement

\> \plot{acceptance_correction/validation/validation_gaussian_approx.pdf} : for the new implementation, comparison of results with and without the gaussian optimisation -- perfect agreement

\> below a study with MC is presented; two versions of simulation have been considered:
\>> ``corr'': including the correlation between $m_x$ and $d_x$ ($\rh \approx 0.2$) and correlation between $m_y$ and $d_y$ ($\rh\approx 0.02$)
\>> ``uncorr'': disregarding the correlations
\>> it will be shown that the correlation has no significant effect

\>>> trigger flag = ev.trigger\_bits \& 7 (i.e.~any of the bits 0, 1 and 2)
\>> then trigger efficiency is obtained as follows:

$$1 - I_{\rm trig} = {N({\rm BX,elastic,trigger}) \over N({\rm BX,elastic})}$$

\> results:
\>> fill 5317, diagonal 45 bot -- 56 top: $N({\rm BX,elastic}) = N({\rm BX,elastic,trigger}) = 7185$
\>> fill 5317, diagonal 45 top -- 56 bot: $N({\rm BX,elastic}) = N({\rm BX,elastic,trigger}) = 6648$

\> this correction is not applied since it does not modify $t$-distribution shape



\subsection{DAQ efficiency}

\> method: per time slice calculate from the trigger block of raw data:
$$\hbox{DAQ efficiency} = {N(\hbox{recorded events})\over N(\hbox{triggered events})} \equiv 1 - I_{\rm DAQ}$$

\> \plot{efficiencies/daq_efficiency.pdf}: DAQ efficiency as function of time

\> this correction is not applied since it does not modify $t$-distribution shape



\subsection{Pile-up}

\> method
\>> take BX sample, split it into time slices
\>> per RP, evaluate frequency of ``destructive`` signal that would break reconstruction if piled up with an elastic event

$$I^{i}_{\rm PU} = {N(\hbox{destructive signal in RP $i$})\over N(\hbox{anything})}$$

\>> typical conditions of ``destructivity``
\>>> ``pl\_suff'': sufficient number of planes is on
\>>> ``pat\_suff'': at least one U or V pattern is recognised 
\>> combination from RPs
\>>> use AND between 210-fr and 220-fr to avoid double-counting with 3-out-of-4
\>>> use OR between left and right arm -- it is sufficient to loose any arm to loose the elastic event

$$I_{\rm PU} = {N(\hbox{destructive signal in (45-210-fr AND 45-220-fr) OR (56-210-fr AND 56-220-fr)})\over N(\hbox{anything})}$$


\> \plot{efficiencies/pileup_details.pdf}: contributions from each RP and their combinations; per diagonal

\> \plot{efficiencies/pileup.pdf}: final inefficiency as a function of time

\> this correction is not applied since it does not modify $t$-distribution shape



\subsection{Uncorrelated single RP inefficiencies (3-out-of-4)}

\> method
\>> remove a RP from the elastic selection
\>> redo a simplified analysis without the RP under test
\>> for selected events, look how often the studied RP has a track (compatible with the tagged event)

\> study with reconstructed tracks
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_fits.pdf}: efficiency as function of $\th_y^*$
\>>> observation: the efficiency plateau has a slope
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_2D.pdf}: efficiency as function of $\th_x^*$ and $\th_y^*$
\>>> no significant phase-space dependence observed
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_n_si_cmp.pdf}: efficiency as function of $\th_y^*$, for different choices of the selection $n_\si$
\>>> no significant dependence on $n_\si$ observed
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_vs_time.pdf}: efficiency as function of time
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_fits_summary.pdf}: summary of plateau fit results (slope and intercept)
\>>> good agreement among datasets

\> study with also lower-level objects (patterns, hits, ...)
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_details.pdf}: (in)efficiencies as function of $\th_y^*$
\>> \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_details_2D.pdf}: (in)efficiencies as function of $\th_x^*$ and $\th_y^*$

\> final correction derived from the solid lines in \plot{efficiencies/eff3outof4_fits_summary.pdf} by summing over the RPs:

$$I_{\rm 1RP}(\th_y^*) = \sum\limits_{i \in\hbox{\SmallerFonts 220-fr}} I_{\rm 1RP}^i(\th_y^*)$$

\>> value at $\th_y^* = 0$: typically about $10.5\un{\%}$, uncertainty $0.4\un{\%}$
\>> slope: typically about $250\un{rad^{-1}}$, uncertainty $20\un{rad^{-1}}$

\> this correction is applied since it modifies the $t$-distribution shape



\subsection{Correlated RP inefficiencies}

\> typical case: shower initiated upstream (210-far) propagates downstream (220-far)
\>> this is not included in the uncorrelated single-RP inefficiency above

\> method: external study (Geant4, data driven check at $\sqrt s = 8\un{TeV}$)
\>> inefficiency per arm: $(1.5 \pm 0.7)\un{\%}$ (e.g.~from 1km or non-exponential paper)
\>> total inefficiency (two arms):

$$I_{2RP} = (3 \pm 1)\un{\%}$$

\> this correction is applied since it modifies the $t$-distribution shape

\section{Unfolding of resolution effects}

\> method
\>> take a fit of data with model including both Coulomb and hadronic contributions
\>> this fits serves as an input (truth) to simulation with and without smearing effects
\>> ratio of these two curves gives unfolding correction
\eqref{U(\th) = {H_{\rm smear,corr}(\th)\over h_{\rm true}(\th)}}{unfold corr}
where the numerator comes from \Eq{sm model th corr} and therefore this correction takes into account the small bias introduced in acceptance correction handling
\>>> in practice the correction $U$ is evaluated as a function of $t$

\> there are two evaluations of \Eq{unfold corr}
\>> numerical integration: fast, accurate
\>> Monte Carlo: very simple implementation, needs long computing time for reasonable accuracy
\>> \plot{unfolding/cmp_mc_num_int.pdf} : comparison of the two methods -- very good agreement

\> \plot{unfolding/num_int_model_cmp.pdf} : dependence on the initial data fit
\>> differences only at high $|t|$, always below $0.1\un{\%}$
\>> the fit "fit2-1" doesn't describe the dip well and should be thus handled with caution

\> results -- as expected
\>> effects in general small -- very small beam divergence
\>> effects only present at low $|t|$ (strong non-linearity due to Coulomb) and at dip region

\> \TODO: add comments on uncertainty
\>> model dependence
\>> dependence on $\si(m_x)$
\>> dependence on $\si(m_y)$


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Normalisation}

\> method
\>> normalise $\d\si/\d t$ such that $I + S = 31.2\un{mb}$ (see Frici's presentation in Collaboration Meeting on 13 Sep 2017)
\>> $I$ stands for $\d\si/\d t$ fit over $0.01 < |t| < 0.05\un{GeV^2}$, integrated over $0 < |t| < 0.01\un{GeV^2}$
\>> $S$ stands for histogram integral of bins $0.01 < |t| < 0.5\un{GeV^2}$
