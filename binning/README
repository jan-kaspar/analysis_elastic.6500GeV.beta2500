The steps are as follows.

1. Run make

		"../DS-XXX/distributions_XXX.root"
	object
		"acceptance correction/ob-1-30-0.05/p_t_full_corr"
	and save it as
		"acceptance_correction.root"

3. Run "./make_fit" which will fit histogram
		"ob-1-30-0.05/merged/45b_56t/h_dsdt"
	from
		"../DS-merged/merged.root"
	and save into
		"dN_dt_fit.root"
